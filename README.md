Geometry Processing @ LMU Munich Winter Semester 2021/22

- Homepage: [http://mimuc.de/gp](http://mimuc.de/gp)
- Instructor: [Changkun Ou](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/team/changkun.ou/)
- Responsible Professor: [Prof. Dr. Butz](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/team/andreas.butz/)
- Date: Monday, 2 p.m. - 6 p.m. [c.t.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_quarter_(class_timing)) (starts on Oct 18, 2021)
- Location: Frauenlobstr. 7a, Raum 357

## Prerequisites

The course is designed for senior bachelor students or master students
who have taken those following courses (or have equivalent knowledge):

- [Computer Graphics 1](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ss21/cg1/)

Registration is open at [Uni2Work](https://uni2work.ifi.lmu.de/course/W21/IfI/GP).

## Preparation

We will introduce and use the following toolkits for this course:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (2.93+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (14.17+)
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.17+)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.9+)

Please install all of them in advance and take a glance to these tools beforehand.

## Communication

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/mimuc/gp) to manage all course resources, submissions, project proposals, etc. and use the [discussions](https://github.com/mimuc/gp/discussions) feature for online questions and discussions.

Please register yourself on GitHub if you do not have a GitHub account. You can use any distinguishable identifier for your username if you do not want your real name to appear on GitHub publicly.

## Syllabus

In this practical course, students will learn and practice more about geometry processing algorithms in 3D graphics, including mesh representation, discrete differential geometry, smoothing, parameterization, remeshing, deformation, shape analysis, etc.

Students will participate in the course every week to discuss and learn more geometry processing techniques at the beginning of the semester, then do 5 out of 8 geometry processing coding projects.

During the rest of the semester, students should propose a project idea throughout the semester, and by the end of the semester, implement and demonstrate their project in 1) idea-pitch presentation; 2) intermediate presentation; 3) final presentation.
